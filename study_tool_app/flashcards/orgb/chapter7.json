    "front": "What is rational choice decision making?",
    "back": "A logical process of using all available information to choose the alternative with the highest expected value or utility."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the two key elements of rational choice?",
    "back": "1. Calculating the best alternative.\n2. Following a systematic decision-making process."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the steps in the rational choice decision process?",
    "back": "1. Identify the problem or opportunity.\n2. Choose decision criteria.\n3. Develop alternatives.\n4. Evaluate alternatives.\n5. Choose the best alternative.\n6. Implement and evaluate the decision."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the five problem identification challenges?",
    "back": "1. Stakeholder framing.\n2. Decisive leadership.\n3. Solution-focused problems.\n4. Perceptual defence.\n5. Mental models."
  },
  {
    "front": "How can you identify problems more effectively?",
    "back": "1. Be aware of identification biases.\n2. Resist appearing overly decisive.\n3. Foster 'divine discontent.'\n4. Discuss the situation with others."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is the difference between rational choice assumptions and OB evidence?",
    "back": "Rational choice assumes people are logical and fully informed, while OB shows people have limited information, conflicting goals, and use shortcuts (heuristics)."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is sequential appraisal and implicit favourite bias?",
    "back": "People tend to evaluate alternatives one at a time and favour an implicit favourite, comparing others to it rather than judging them objectively."
  },
  {
    "front": "Why do people rely on sequential appraisal?",
    "back": "Because alternatives are not always available simultaneously, humans prefer simple comparisons, minimize effort, and seek cognitive consistency."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the three common decision-making heuristics?",
    "back": "1. Anchoring and adjustment heuristic.\n2. Availability heuristic.\n3. Representativeness heuristic."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is the problem with maximization in decision making?",
    "back": "People rarely maximize; they satisfice (choose a 'good enough' option), oversimplify decisions, or avoid making one entirely."
  },
  {
    "front": "How do emotions affect decision making?",
    "back": "1. Emotions shape preferences before conscious evaluation.\n2. Moods influence the decision process.\n3. Emotions serve as information during decision making."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is intuition in decision making?",
    "back": "An ability to recognize opportunities or problems and choose actions without conscious reasoning, based on emotional signals and learned mental models."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is the role of intuition in decision making?",
    "back": "It provides rapid, emotional insight using nonconscious pattern recognition (action scripts), but should be balanced with logical analysis."
  },
  {
    "front": "How can people make choices more effectively?",
    "back": "1. Be contemplative, not impulsive.\n2. Combine intuition with logic.\n3. Revisit decisions when emotions change.\n4. Use scenario planning."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is postdecisional justification?",
    "back": "The tendency to distort or reinterpret information to justify a previous decision."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is escalation of commitment?",
    "back": "Continuing to invest in a failing decision due to psychological and social pressures."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the causes of escalation of commitment?",
    "back": "1. Self-justification effect.\n2. Self-enhancement effect.\n3. Prospect theory effect.\n4. Sunk costs effect."
  },
  {
    "front": "How can decision evaluation be improved?",
    "back": "1. Separate decision maker from evaluator.\n2. Create a stop-loss point.\n3. Seek factual and social feedback.\n4. Change the decision-maker’s mindset."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the four stages of the creative process model?",
    "back": "1. Preparation – developing skills and knowledge.\n2. Incubation – subconscious reflection.\n3. Illumination – sudden insight or discovery.\n4. Verification – testing and validating the idea."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the key characteristics of creative people?",
    "back": "Independent imagination, knowledge, persistence, curiosity, and moderate risk-taking."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are features of a creative work environment?",
    "back": "1. Learning orientation.\n2. Enriched jobs (autonomy, significance).\n3. Open communication.\n4. Job security.\n5. Supportive leadership and vision."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are creative activities that stimulate innovation?",
    "back": "1. Redefining problems.\n2. Associative play.\n3. Cross-pollination.\n4. Design thinking."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is design thinking?",
    "back": "A human-centered, solution-oriented creative process combining empathy, logic, and experimentation."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the four rules of design thinking?",
    "back": "1. Human rule – involve users.\n2. Ambiguity rule – avoid early problem definition.\n3. Re-design rule – build on past solutions.\n4. Tangible rule – prototype and test ideas."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is employee involvement?",
    "back": "The degree to which employees influence decisions related to their work, units, or organization."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are the levels of employee involvement?",
    "back": "Low – provide information only.\nMedium-low – provide input after problem is described.\nMedium-high – develop recommendations collectively.\nHigh – identify, analyze, and implement decisions."

    "front": "What are the benefits of employee involvement?",
    "back": "Improved decision quality, commitment, and employee motivation."
